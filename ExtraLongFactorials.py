'''
You are given an integer N. Print the factorial of this number.

Input 
Input consists of a single integer N, where  1 <= N < 100.

Output 
Print the factorial of N .

Example 
For an input of 25, you would print 15511210043330985984000000.

Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. 
Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. 
can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to 
handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
