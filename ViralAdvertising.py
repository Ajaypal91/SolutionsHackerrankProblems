When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly  people on social media.

On the first day, half of those  people (i.e., ) 
like the advertisement and each person shares it with  of their friends; 
the remaining people (i.e., ) delete the advertisement because it doesn't

So, at the beginning of the third day,  people receive the advertisement. 
The diagram below depicts the advertisement's virality over the first three days
