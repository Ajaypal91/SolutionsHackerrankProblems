This is solution to the problem of creating a balanced binary tree and finding if a path exists anywhere from root node to leaf node with sum equal to given values.

Input:
The input are integer with new lines. The first integer determines the number of nodes n in the tree. Consective n inputs determine the nodes of the tree and the last input is the sum to check if it is present in the tree path.

Example 
5 - n
1
2
3
4
5
3 - sum to check

	1
       / \
      2  3
     / \
    4  5

Sum 3 is present in path 1-2 = 3
